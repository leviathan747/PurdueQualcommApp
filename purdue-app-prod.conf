# Purdue App server upstart job file
#
#   Ensure that a Github WebHook URL has been configured for the following
#   URL.  This enables the server to restart itself automatically when new
#   commits are pushed to the branch:
#
#       http://$(hostname -f):3000/stopServer
#
#
# Install:
#   $ sudo cp purdue-app-prod.conf /etc/init

#
#   Runtime logs can be found at /var/log/upstart/purdue-app-prod.log
#
# Stop:
#   $ sudo service purdue-app-prod stop
