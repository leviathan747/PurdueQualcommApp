Overwhelming would be the first word to come to mind when summarizing the next few days in the labs, and I took the opportunity to ask away at every moment of confusion that I had - A LOT of questions were asked. I’m sure the typical wide-eyed intern glance was showing all over my face. As the week progressed, I quickly understood the role of my team and retained so much more information than I’m sure I would have in the typical lecture hall setting. There are definitely huge gaps of information needing to be filled in my head, and I’ll be pushing to close that gap as the summer goes on.',
